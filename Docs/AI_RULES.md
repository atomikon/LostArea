# AI Rules

- Do not invent mechanics or change rules not written in Docs
- Respect stamina, interruption, parry eligibility, weapon teleport, interaction targeting, and dodge rules
- Implement complete systems, not fragments
- Prefer extensibility over shortcuts
- If a requirement conflicts with current code, follow Docs and fix code
